# Résumé

Simple markdown résumé template, inspired by [Butterick's Practical Typography][practypo].

Search for Markdown résumés and you will find the universal tool is `pandoc`.
The output PDF is generated by `wkhtmltopdf`, since this template uses HTML as
an intermediate format to apply styling with CSS.

This template uses markdown headings to select and style the different attributes
of each item. The details can be found in `resume.css`.

### Fonts:
- Spectral
- Spectral SC
- IBM Plex Mono

Fonts are loaded directly from Google Fonts, usage of local fonts has a small
bug in the weight selection.
To install with brew:
```bash
brew install font-spectral font-ibm-plex
```

## Usage
To build PDF or output HTML for debugging and what not:
```bash
make [pdf|html]
```
To export with contact info and commit short hash:
```bash
make print
```
**Warning:** This will perform a `git restore` to clear out personal details from header.
